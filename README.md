# GP_PT_Remote_Public

Initially created to work with the GP Session 5, should work with later models as well as naked versions. 

Designed to work plug and play with the TTGO T-Display, and DIY version using an ESP32 push buttons (2x) and an oled screen, works with the HiLetgo ESP32 OLED but an extra push button is required.
